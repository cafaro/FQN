# FQN
Fast online Qn estimator

This repository hosts the source code related to the C implementation of the FQN (Fast Qn) algorithm for online detection of outliers in data streams. We also provide source code for the implementation of the competing algorithm by Nunkesser et al. and for a variant of Nunkesser in which the buffer B is limited to linear size.

Finally, the repository also hosts synthetic datasets generated according to specific distributions.
